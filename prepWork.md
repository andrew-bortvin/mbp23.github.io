In this course, we will use the Google Colab platform. Please find a brief description of how to use Colab [here](https://mcgrawect.princeton.edu/guides/Google-Colab-Introduction.pdf).

We have prepared two notebooks that will introduce you the basics of coding in Python. If you are new to Python, please read these and try out the exercises in advance of class:
